# Description

smart contracts for the Cryptolympians NFT project.

currently it's just one contract implementing the ERC721 collection and the logic for auctions (our intial distribution method).

tests can be found in the tests/ directory

to set this project up locally, you'll also need a hardhat.config.ts file on your machine. i haven't uploaded it because it contains private keys.

If the missing config file is a problem, open an issue and i'll move the sensitive info into environment vars and upload the config file.
